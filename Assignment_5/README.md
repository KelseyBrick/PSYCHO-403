### Experiment structure exercises

see [file name](link).

**Note**: this code may change based on subsequent exercises used to complete this experiment's code.
- Lines 54-66: these include possible properities required in this experiment. Some may be added, deleted, or modified based on final code.
- Lines 123, 125, 127: no for loops or .append() methods have been added. This code will be required in future to direct the program to add certain information to the lists.
- Line 157: has alternate code option
- Line 164: the *for loop* has not been expanded past the initial execution. Additionally, if the randomized conditions list from line 156 is used the variables in this loop may need to be chnaged (i.e., looping through the counterbalanced conditions list vs. nTrials.

### Import exercises

```
#=====================
#IMPORT MODULES
#=====================
import numpy as np
#-import psychopy functions
from psychopy import core, gui, visual, event
#-import file save functions
import json
#-(import other functions as necessary: os...)

```
**Note**: more moldules may require importing in future edits of this program's code.

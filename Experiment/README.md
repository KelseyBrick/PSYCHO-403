### This is current version of Waldo's experiment:
[Waldo experiment script](https://github.com/KelseyBrick/PSYCHO-403-Fall-2022/blob/main/Experiment/waldoExp_v3.py)

* click_times are filling a list; think I want to change this to cumulative time at each click (right now it is more of an RT time)
* want to implement a whole trial time per image (minus time taken when participants asked click)
* add saved data parameters around True v. False finds on Waldo
* implement Full, 2/3, 1/3 images for different groups (need to edit images which I can do quickly in PhotoShop; then code block per group?) 
* counter balance conditions (should be easy)
* add GUI (easy)
* add data saving (also easy)

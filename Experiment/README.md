This script was created as an experiment helper. This experiemnt will not work without identifying a click location of a target. 
* Allows the experimenter to set a list of target coordinates that are then imported into the actual experiment.
* Script is designed to mark the target and pause to ensure the location choice was accurate.
* A click count could be added to this if an average or range of click locations was desired. 
* Any images containing a target could be used in place of Waldo photos.
